# Bare Metal Device Drivers for Nucleo Board (STM32F09xx)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of bare metal device drivers designed for the Nucleo development board equipped with STM32F0xx microcontrollers. The primary goal of this project is to provide a set of lightweight, efficient, and low-level drivers that interface directly with the hardware peripherals of the STM32F0 to facilitate embedded systems development.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Driver Support**: Implement drivers for various peripherals including GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, and Timer modules.
- **Minimal Overhead**: Designed for performance and low memory usage, suitable for resource-constrained environments.
- **Portability**: Easy to adapt and integrate into different projects using STM32F0xx microcontrollers.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Each driver includes usage examples and comprehensive documentation for easy understanding and implementation.

## Target Device Drivers to be supported

1. **GPIO Driver**: Control and configure general-purpose input/output pins for digital I/O operations.
2. **UART Driver**: Provide capabilities for serial communication, supporting various baud rates and configurations.
3. **SPI Driver**: Interface with SPI-based devices for high-speed data transfer.
4. **I2C Driver**: Enable communication with I2C peripherals, supporting master and slave modes.
5. **ADC Driver**: Interface with analog-to-digital converters to read analog signals.
6. **Timer Driver**: Configure and utilize timers for generating precise time delays and event scheduling.

## Future Work

- **Additional Drivers**: Extend support to include more peripherals as required.
- **Testing Framework**: Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for driver validation and performance benchmarking.
- **Examples and Tutorials**: Create example applications to demonstrate the use of each driver in real-world scenarios.
